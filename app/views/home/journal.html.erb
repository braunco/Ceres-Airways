      <h4>A journal entry from a top college student selected as an architect.</h5>
      <br>
      <p>I was selected as an engineer for the Ceres missions. In short, an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and trigger a series of earthquakes, tsunamis, and natural disasters that will lead to an on-Earth apocalypse. So we're leaving. Who's we? A group of 200 people including scientists, engineers (like me), architects, and mathemeticians. I'm one of the top prospects in architecture. I went to college when I was 16, and graduated from MIT in 3 years. I went back to Harvard to get a PHD in achitecture and design. I still can't believe they chose me! I'm going to space in now less than 100 days. I'm the only one in my family that knows about any of this. They haven't told anyone yet, but I'm guessing people have gotten suspicous with the 76 probes that have been launched into the atmosphere over our city. They have all the liquid states of the gasses needed, some plants, food, and fuel. Next is the 25 passengers. These 25 people, as well as countlesses plants and algaes will be temporarily traveling to the ISS. I'm in the ship following that one. It contains the other 175 people traveling to Ceres. They tell me the ship I'm traveling on also is carrying cargo. My ship, <i>Ceres III</i>, launches in 100 days. I'm not sure how I feel. Grateful? Sad? Excited? Maybe a little bit of everything. I just hope I don't let them down.</p>

      <p>Something bad happened. <i>Ceres-Gemini I</i> started to break down with the weight. We've decided to make two ships.</p>
